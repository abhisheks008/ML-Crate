<h1>World Population Growth Analysis</h1>

**GOAL**

To analyze the 'world-population-growth' Dataset using Exploratory Data analysis.

**DATASET**

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rafsunahmad/world-population-growth

**DESCRIPTION**

The dataset contains population of various countries and cities in year 2022 and 2023. Also the dataset provides population growth rate in each city.
The type column has 2 unique values, 'w' for world and 'us' for USA.

The dataset contains the following columns:
- population_in_2023
- population_in_2022       
- city                    
- country                 
- population_growthRate  
- type                   

**WHAT I HAD DONE**

* Checked for missing values and cleaned the data accordingly
* Analyzed the data, found insights and visualized them accordingly.
* Found detailed insights of different columns with one another using plotting libraries.
