**Pcos Detection**

🎯**GOAL**

The aim of the project is to build a model which would predict whether a person has the Pcos Detection

🧵**DATASET**

The dataset was taken from the Kaggle.

🧾**DESCRIPTION**

In this project, we compare the accuracies of different models to predict the pcos in the person.

🧮**WHAT I HAD DONE**

Steps followed:
* Downloaded the dataset from Kaggle.
* Checked for null values and performed exploratory data analysis
* Built models using the following algorithms: Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest
* Compared the accuracies
* Then performed cross validation on all the algorithms to see if the accuraries imrpove.

🚀 **Models Implemented**

1) Logistic Regression
2) Decision Tree
3) Random forest
4) Gradient Boosting
5) Adaboost
6) Naive Bayes
7) Support Vector Machine
8) K-Nearest Neighbors

📚**LIBRARIES NEEDED**

* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Numpy
* Sklearn
