DESCRIPTION
To solve this problem and enhance the state of the art in object detection and classification

WORK DONE
There’s been a 4.2× reduction in image classification error (from 28.2% to 6.7%) and a 1.7× reduction in localization error (from 42.5% to 25.3%) between 2010 and 2020 alone. 

LIBRARIES NEEDED
pathlib
PIL
numpy
random
Image

CONCLUSION
So we have successfully created the model to classify the blur images.
