## ** End to End Email Spam Classifier**

### 🎯 **Goal**

The goal of email spam classification is to enhance user experience by organizing and prioritizing emails, detecting and filtering out spam, improving security, and ensuring that legitimate messages receive attention. It streamlines communication, reduces annoyance, and protects users from malicious content. 📧🔍

### 🧵 **Dataset**

the Dataset used int the project is taken from kaggle spam Dataset

### 🧮 **What I had done!**

 In email spam classification project, I evaluated various models and found that Support Vector Machines (SVM) achieved the highest accuracy. SVMs are powerful classifiers that excel in separating data into distinct classes by finding an optimal hyperplane. Their success lies in their ability to handle both linear and non-linear data through kernel functions. By maximizing the margin between classes, SVMs effectively minimize misclassifications. Consequently, your results highlight SVMs as a robust choice for spam detection, contributing to better email filtering and enhanced user experience. 📧🔍🚀

### 🧾 **Description**

Email spam classification refers to the process of automatically categorizing incoming emails as either spam (unsolicited, irrelevant, or potentially harmful) or legitimate (also known as “ham”). The goal is to enhance user experience by organizing and prioritizing emails, reducing annoyance, and protecting users from malicious content. Various machine learning models, including Support Vector Machines (SVMs), are commonly used for accurate spam detection. 📧🔍🚀

### 🚀 **Models Implemented**

I have used various models like Linear Regression , K-Neighbors Classifier , Naive bayes ,Decision Tree Classifier and Support Vector Machine for training and in all of them the maximum accuracy of the models turns out to be the Support Vector Machine

### 📚 **Libraries Needed**

- scikit-learn: Machine learning library for model training and evaluation.
- pandas: Data manipulation library for preprocessing and data handling.
- numpy: Numerical computing library for mathematical operations.
- matplotlib, seaborn, plotly: Visualization libraries for data exploration and analysis.
