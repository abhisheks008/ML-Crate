## MODELS USED
- Naive Bayes
- Random Forest
- Catboost
- Decision Tree
- Bidirectional LSTM
- RNN
- Logistic Regression

## LIBRARIES
- Pandas
- Numpy
- TensorFlow
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## IMPLEMENTATION
1. Loaded Dataset
2. Converted into standard csv file and renamed columns for ease.
3. Implemented cleaning and preprocessing to remove any emojis,symbols,links,etc
4. Classified toxic comment on the basis if intensity of angered comment > 0.55 then its toxic.
5. Implement tokenization for sequence conversion.
6. Trained models with various algorithms.
