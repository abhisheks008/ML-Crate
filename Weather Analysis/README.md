**WHAT I HAD DONE**

* Load the dataset which is CSV format.
* It has 3902 entries(Rows), 22 columns.
* Checked for missing values and cleaned the data accordingly.
* Analyzed the data, found insights and visualized them accordingly.
* Found detailed insights of different columns with target variable using plotting libraries.
* Train the datasets by different models and saves their accuracies into a dataframe.


**LIBRARIES NEEDED**

1. Pandas
2. Matplotlib
3. Sklearn
4. NumPy
5. XGBoost
6. Tensorflow
7. Keras
8. Sci-py
9. Seaborn



**CONCLUSION**

- Random Forest and XGBoost Regression models show promising performance with lower MSE and higher R-square values for both training set and dataset.
- Decision Tree Regression achieved perfect R-square on the training set but on the test set it's value is 0.6, indicating overfitting.
- Deep Neural Network (NN) has a high MSE and negative R-square on testing set, approximately zero on training set, suggesting poor performance on both training and test sets.
