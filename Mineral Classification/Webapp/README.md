# Mineral Classification Web App

## Goal 🎯
This project focuses on classifying mineral images into distinct categories using machine learning models. The goal is to automatically identify different types of minerals based on their visual characteristics captured in images.

## Model(s) Used for the Web App 🧮
The model used in this web app is a pre-trained Logistic Regression, which has been fine-tuned for mineral classification.
