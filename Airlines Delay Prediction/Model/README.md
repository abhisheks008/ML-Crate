## Goal

The goal of this project is to predict the delay of airlines from the given dataset.
## Dataset
I have Downloaded this dataset from kaggle website. Here is the link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jimschacko/airlines-dataset-to-predict-a-delay

## What Have I Done?

- Imported all the required libraries and dataset for this project.
- Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualizing different aspects of the dataset.
- Finding number of observations and outliers in the dataset.
- Plotting different attributes of the dataset.
- Building the machine learning model.
- Finding the ost delayed Airline.

## Library used:
1. numpy
2. pandas
3. plotly 
4. matplotlib
5. seaborn
6. lightgbm
7. category_encoders
8. sklearn
## Visualization and EDA of different attributes:
